## Sudoku

One of my first projects with Unity. I got the idea of making this when I was studying about Sudoku in CS220 - Applied Data Structures, Spring Term 2023.

## Algorithm and UI

[I used the typical Sudoku board generate algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/program-sudoku-generator/)
For UI:
Button 1-9. To add a number to the grid, click on the desired square, then choose one of the nine numbers
Check Button: Check if the board is correct; green is for yes, and red is for no. If you score all green when the button is pressed, you win
Home Button: Back to Main Menu
Hint Button: Give the correct answer for the desired cell
The game doesn't save progress, so if you accidentally press Home, I'm sorry :((

## P/S

It has been a while since I last opened this project. Now looking at it, I realized it can be renovated more: starting with cleaning up the code, adding an Undo/Redo button, a Solve-all button, so I don't 
have to press the Hint button 40 times, a resume button to prevent accidentally pressing Home, and difficulty settings.
